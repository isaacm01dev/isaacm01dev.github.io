Hi, 

This is just a first try for a portfolio website using glassmorphysim and some other stuff. There are no links yet though,  just wanted to have it in github.

I used plain CSS, and only some JS but I still want to add some more features if it will finally becomes my main portfolio website. I'm just giving it a try.
